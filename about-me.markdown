👋 Hi there! I'm Josh 🧔🏻 and I live in beautiful [Camarillo](https://www.ci.camarillo.ca.us/Visitors/Discover%20Camarillo.pdf), California 🌅 with my wife Whitnie 👸🏼 and my husky-mix Maya 🐕.

I currently work for a technology consultancy company 👨🏻‍💻 on their End User Computing ([EUC](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/end-user-computing)) team. I really enjoy it since I get to work with some pretty cool [virtualized desktop](https://www.citrix.com) 🏝 and [cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com) ☁️ technologies!

Ever since I was little 👶🏻, I've been interested in computers and technology 💾. While attending California State University, Northridge [(CSUN)](https://www.csun.edu), I applied for a part time job 💰 selling computers 🏷. Wanting to work with technology rather then sell it, I found a consulting role that allowed me to gain experience with enterprise technologies 📈. When I graduated 👨🏻‍🎓 (with a B.S. in Business Management and a Minor in Information Systems), my previous experience allowed me to start work full time in a help desk role ☎️. Over the years, I worked to learn new skills and technologies which lead to me being promoted to Systems Engineer 👨🏻‍💼.  I eventually realized that I wanted to use my knowledge and experience to help other companies and I decided to return to consulting. The stars aligned ✨ and I ended at with an amazing job!
